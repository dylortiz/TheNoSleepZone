# The No Sleep Zone

## What is The No Sleep Zone?
This is an arduino based alarm clock that uses a scale to sense when the user is still in bed, after the alarm has gone off. What makes
this different from a regular alarm clock is that there is no snooze, you have no choice but to get out of bed. If you do not, the 
arduino will detect that there is weight on the bed, provided from the scale, and keep the alarm going off. Only when the arduino does
not sense any weight on the bed will the alarm go off. 

## Who am I?
I am a UCF student in Computer Engineering, looking to do a project that is both beneficial to me, and teaches me how to interact
digital pieces of hardware with one another, ergo the bathroom scale and Arduino

## Why am I making this?
I have found that I am a heavy sleeper, and that I often don't give myself enough time to relax and enjoy my morning before my day gets
started. With this, after the first alarm has waken me up, unless I get up it will continue to go off indefinetely.
